Hi there, I’m DEVKANT SWARGIARY.


I’m interested in Web Development and Open Source Projects.


I’m currently learning YAML & JSON in order to use it efficiently in Cloud Programming.


I have worked upon MACHINE LEARNING frameworks : Sci-kit learn

I have worked with Django and Flask and built Blog websites and Ticketing System (CRUD operations) .
I have built and added features like Image slide using plain Vanilla JavaScript. I have also built a few landing pages with React Js.
